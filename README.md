# REST API (without express)


### Todo

- [ ] Code must be covered with unit tests
- [x] Clean, easy to understand and maintainable 
- [x] Be RESTful
- [x] Validate inputs
- [x] Avoid using frameworks (e.g. Laravel, Sprint Boot) -- weâ€™d like to see all code written from the ground up to understand your abilities regardless of a framework

#### Bonus 
- [x] Dockerize

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- NodeJS, Mongodb, Joi (validation library)
